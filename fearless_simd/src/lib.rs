//! A helper library to make SIMD more friendly.
//!
//! Fearless SIMD exposes safe SIMD with ergonomic multi-versioning in Rust.
//!
//! Fearless SIMD uses "marker values" which serve as proofs of which target features are available on the current CPU.
//! These each implement the [`Simd`] trait, which exposes a core set of SIMD operations which are implemented as
//! efficiently as possible on each target platform.
//!
//! Additionally, there are types for packed vectors of a specific width and element type (such as [`f32x4`]).
//! Fearless SIMD does not currently support vectors of less than 128 bits.
//! These vector types implement some standard arithmetic traits (i.e. they can be added together using
//! `+`, multiplied by a scalar using `*`, among others), which are implemented as efficiently
//! as possible using SIMD instructions.
//! These can be created in a SIMD context using the [`SimdFrom`] trait, or the
//! [`from_slice`][SimdBase::from_slice] associated function.
//!
//! To call a function with the best available target features and get the associated `Simd`
//! implementation, use the [`dispatch!()`] macro:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use fearless_simd::{Level, Simd, dispatch};
//!
//! #[inline(always)]
//! fn sigmoid<S: Simd>(simd: S, x: &[f32], out: &mut [f32]) { /* ... */ }
//!
//! // The stored level, which you should only construct once in your application.
//! let level = Level::new();
//!
//! dispatch!(level, simd => sigmoid(simd, &[/*...*/], &mut [/*...*/]));
//! ```
//!
//! A few things to note:
//!
//! 1) `sigmoid` is generic over any `Simd` type.
//! 2) The [`dispatch`] macro is used to invoke the given function with the target features associated with the supplied [`Level`].
//! 3) The function or closure passed to [`dispatch!()`] should be `#[inline(always)]`.
//!    The performance of the SIMD implementation may be poor if that isn't the case. See [the section on inlining for details](#inlining)
//!
//! The first parameter to [`dispatch!()`] is the [`Level`].
//! If you are writing an application, you should create this once (using [`Level::new`]), and pass it to any function which wants to use SIMD.
//! This type stores which instruction sets are available for the current process, which is used
//! in the macro to dispatch to the most optimal variant of the supplied function for this process.
//!
//! # Inlining
//!
//! Fearless SIMD relies heavily on Rust's inlining support to create functions which have the
//! given target features enabled.
//! As such, most functions which you write when using Fearless SIMD should have the `#[inline(always)]` attribute..
//!
//! <!--
//! # Kernels vs not kernels
//!
//! TODO: Talk about writing versions of functions which can be called in other `S: Simd` functions.
//! I think this pattern can also have a macro.
//! -->
//!
//! # Webassembly
//!
//! WASM SIMD doesn't have feature detection, and so you need to compile two versions of your bundle for WASM, one with SIMD and one without,
//! then select the appropriate one for your user's browser.
//! TODO: Expand on this.
//!
//! ## Credits
//!
//! This crate was inspired by [`pulp`], [`std::simd`], among others in the Rust ecosystem, though makes many decisions differently.
//! It benefited from conversations with Luca Versari, though he is not responsible for any of the mistakes or bad decisions.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! The following crate [feature flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features) are available:
//!
//! - `std` (enabled by default): Get floating point functions from the standard library (likely using your target's libc).
//!   Also allows using [`Level::new`] on all platforms, to detect which target features are enabled.
//! - `libm`: Use floating point implementations from [libm].
//! - `safe_wrappers`: Include safe wrappers for (some) target feature specific intrinsics,
//!   beyond the basic SIMD operations abstracted on all platforms.
//!
//! At least one of `std` and `libm` is required; `std` overrides `libm`.
//!
