# Fearless SIMD macros

This crate provides the `#[simd]` attribute for
[`fearless_simd`](https://crates.io/crates/fearless_simd). It is versioned
separately so that the macro can evolve without adding a procedural-macro
dependency to `fearless_simd` itself.

Add both packages from crates.io to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
fearless_simd = "1.0"
fearless_simd_macros = "0.1"
```

The library must be in scope as `fearless_simd` in the module containing the
annotated function. The dependency declaration above makes that name available
automatically. `fearless_simd` v1.0 or later is required.

Apply `#[simd]` to a function whose first argument is its SIMD token:

```rust,ignore
use fearless_simd::prelude::*;
use fearless_simd_macros::simd;

#[simd]
fn double_u32s<S: Simd>(simd: S, values: &mut [u32]) {
    let mut chunks = values.chunks_exact_mut(S::u32s::N);
    for chunk in &mut chunks {
        let value = S::u32s::from_slice(simd, chunk);
        (value * 2).store_slice(chunk);
    }
    for value in chunks.into_remainder() {
        *value *= 2;
    }
}
```

Conceptually, the macro expands the body to:

```rust,ignore
fn double_u32s<S: Simd>(simd: S, values: &mut [u32]) {
    simd.vectorize(
        #[inline(always)]
        || {
            // Original body.
        },
    )
}
```

The actual implementation is more involved, because arguments captured by the
closure are passed as a struct and are often stored on the stack instead of
being passed in registers, which incurs some overhead. We avoid that overhead
by expanding into a more verbose but slightly more optimal code.

## Accepted functions

The first typed parameter after an optional `self` receiver is treated as the
SIMD token. The parameter takes the token by value and supports identifier
bindings such as `simd: S`, `mut simd: S`, `ref simd: S`, and `ref mut simd: S`.
An unused token may be written as `_: S`; the macro gives it a
private hygienic binding. Destructured and `binding @ pattern`
parameters are not supported for the token. Neither `#[cfg]` nor `#[cfg_attr]`
may be placed on that parameter.

The macro accepts synchronous free functions, inherent methods, trait
implementation methods, and default trait methods. Generic parameters, `where`
clauses, return types, `unsafe`, and non-variadic `extern` ABIs are preserved.
Attribute arguments are not supported: write `#[simd]`, not `#[simd(...)]`.

`async`, `const`, variadic, bodyless, and specialization `default fn`
functions are rejected. The attributes `#[track_caller]`, `#[unsafe(naked)]`,
and `#[instruction_set]` are also rejected because moving the body into a
closure would invalidate their semantics or body requirements.
`#[target_feature]` and other attributes are preserved.

A trait's `#[track_caller]` attribute is inherited by its implementations, but
is not present in the implementation method's token stream when this macro
runs. Applying `#[simd]` to an implementation of a trait method declared with
`#[track_caller]` is therefore unsupported even though the macro cannot
diagnose it.

## Execution boundaries and captures

Only work performed while the function body is executing is covered by the
SIMD context. Code inside a returned future, closure, or lazy iterator runs
later and is not covered. Named helper functions do not inherit the enabled
target features; make them inlineable or annotate their own SIMD-generic body.
Recursive calls enter the dispatcher again.

The original body becomes an always-inline `FnOnce` closure with explicit
parameters. Receivers and parameters carrying `#[cfg]` or `#[cfg_attr]` remain
captures, preserving their existing semantics and uses inside nested macros.
These captures can still require memory when a helper remains out of line.
Rust infers their capture modes from how the body uses them. As with any closure
conversion, the destruction order of captured values is not a stable
substitute for function-parameter destruction order. Avoid relying on the
relative drop order of by-value parameters with observable destructors in a
`#[simd]` function.

The selected token must implement the library's `Simd` trait, normally through
an `S: Simd` bound. The procedural macro invokes
`fearless_simd::__fearless_simd_dispatch!`; the procedural-macro crate itself
does not depend on `fearless_simd`. The library helper owns the unsafe calls
and resolves all proof types through `$crate`, so a lookalike module cannot
substitute counterfeit proof tokens when re-exporting that helper.
Unknown future backends retain the existing `Simd::vectorize` path until the
library helper is updated to generate entries for them.

## Minimum supported Rust version

This version of `fearless_simd_macros` has been verified to compile with Rust
1.89 and later. Future versions may increase this requirement.
